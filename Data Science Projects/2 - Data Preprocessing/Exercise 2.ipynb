    "# Exercise 2: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview: The Bank Dataset contains 11 independent variables specifically age, region, income, sex, married, children, car, save_act, current_act, and mortgage and one response variable which answers the question: “Did the customer buy a PEP (Personal Equity Plan) after the last mailing?” with a yes/no response. Analyze this data beforehand using descriptive analytics and preprocess the data for use in various data mining algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do or answer the following:**\n",
    "1) Load the dataset using `pandas`. The dataset is called *bankdata.csv*. Familiarize yourself with the data by identifying the columns.\n",
    "2) Descriptive Analytics and Visualization:\n",
    "    - What is the range of values of the `Age` variable? What are the minimum, maximum, and middle values?\n",
    "    - How many customers have a savings account? Current account?\n",
    "    - Calculate the means of `Age`, `Income` and `Children` by `PEP`, `Married`, and has `Car`.\n",
    "    - As `Age` increases, what pattern do you see in terms of buying a `PEP`?\n",
    "    - In terms of the number of children, what pattern do you see in terms of buying a `PEP`? For being married?\n",
    "    - Make a histogram of the `Income` variable. *Hint: Try using `matplotlib.pyplot.hist` for this.*\n",
    "        - What can you generalize from this histogram?\n",
    "    - Make a box plot of the `Income` variable by `PEP`. *Hint: Try using `matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot` for this.*\n",
    "        - What can you generalize from this box plot?\n",
    "    - Make a box plot of the `Income` variable by `region`.\n",
    "        - What can you generalize from this box plot?\n",
    "3) Data Transformation:\n",
    "    - Normalize the `Income` column into a [0,1] scale.\n",
    "    - Create an equal depth (frequency) variable for `Income` where the new variable could take in *low*, *medium*, and *high*.\n",
    "4) Sample 100 rows of the bank data without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use a separate cell for your answers to each question.*\n"
